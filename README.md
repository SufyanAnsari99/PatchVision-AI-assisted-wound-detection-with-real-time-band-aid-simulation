# PatchVision-AI-assisted-wound-detection-with-real-time-band-aid-simulation
AI-assisted computer vision system that detects arm wounds and digitally applies a band-aid in real time, creating realistic before-and-after images for healthcare simulation, injury monitoring, and educational purposes.
PatchVision detects arm wounds and digitally applies a band-aid using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. It identifies wound regions, estimates size and orientation, and overlays a transparent band-aid, producing side-by-side before/after images. Lightweight and easy to run, it can be extended for real-time detection and deep learning-based improvements.
PatchVision is a computer vision system using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy to detect arm wounds and overlay a transparent band-aid. It estimates wound size and orientation and produces side-by-side before/after images, enabling automated visual first-aid simulation.
